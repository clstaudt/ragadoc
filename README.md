# Ragadoc 🤖📄

**An AI document assistant that answers questions about your PDFs with citations and highlights them directly in the document.**

Ragadoc is a privacy-first Streamlit application that lets you chat with your documents using locally-run AI models. Ask questions, get grounded answers with citations, and see exactly where the information comes from with automatic PDF highlighting.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🤖 **AI Document Q&A** - Ask natural language questions about your PDFs
- 📍 **Citation Grounding** - Every answer includes specific citations from your document
- 🎯 **PDF Highlighting** - Citations are automatically highlighted in the original PDF
- 🔒 **Complete Privacy** - Uses only local AI models, your documents never leave your computer
- ⚡ **Fast Processing** - Optimized document parsing and retrieval system
- 🌐 **Easy Web Interface** - Simple Streamlit app, no technical knowledge required

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **Install Ollama** (for local AI models):
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install ollama
   
   # Or download from https://ollama.com
   ```

2. **Start Ollama and install required models**:
   ```bash
   ollama serve
   
   # Install embedding model (required)
   ollama pull nomic-embed-text
   
   # Install a chat model (choose one)
   ollama pull qwen3:14b           # Recommended
   ollama pull llama3.1:8b         # Alternative
   ollama pull mistral:latest      # Alternative
   ```

- "Summarize the financial results from Q3"
- "What methodology was used in the study?"
- "List all the recommendations mentioned"

## 🏗️ Architecture

Ragadoc uses a modern RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture:

```
PDF Upload → Text Extraction → Chunking → Vector Embeddings
                                               ↓
User Question → Semantic Search → Context Retrieval → AI Response
                                               ↓
                                    Citation Highlighting
```

**Tech Stack:**
- **Frontend**: Streamlit web interface
- **AI Models**: Ollama (local LLMs)
- **Vector DB**: ChromaDB for semantic search
- **PDF Processing**: PyMuPDF4LLM for structure-aware extraction
- **Embeddings**: nomic-embed-text model

## 🔧 Configuration

### Available Models

The app automatically detects your installed Ollama models. Popular choices:

- **qwen3:14b** - Well-balanced performance and accuracy (recommended)
- **llama3.1:8b** - Good alternative option
- **mistral:latest** - Fast and efficient
- **codellama:latest** - Good for technical documents

### Advanced Settings

Configure in the sidebar:
- **Chunk Size**: How much text to process at once (default: 512)
- **Chunk Overlap**: Text overlap between chunks (default: 50)
- **Top-K Results**: Number of relevant chunks to consider (default: 5)

## 🐳 Docker Support

Run Ragadoc in Docker:

```bash
# Build the image
docker-compose build

# Start the application
docker-compose up
```

Access at `http://localhost:8501`

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

Test the RAG system specifically:

```bash
python experiments/test_rag.py
```

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions! Here's how to get started:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Add tests for new functionality
5. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
6. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
7. Open a Pull Request

### Development Setup

```bash
# Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run tests
pytest

# Run linting
flake8 ragadoc/
```

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Ollama (for local AI models)
- 4GB+ RAM (depending on chosen model)
- PDF documents to analyze

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Ollama Connection Error**
```bash
# Verify Ollama is running
curl http://localhost:11434/api/version

# If using Docker, ensure external access
OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434 ollama serve
```

**No Models Available**
```bash
# Install required models
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
ollama pull qwen3:14b
```

**Slow Performance**
- Try a smaller model like `mistral:latest`
- Reduce chunk size in settings
- Ensure sufficient RAM is available
