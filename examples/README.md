This directory contains demonstration and example files for the Ragnarok PDF highlighting system.

## Files

### `demo_highlighting.py`
A comprehensive Streamlit demo application that showcases the PyMuPDF highlighting capabilities. This demo includes:

- **Manual Text Search** - Search for specific terms and highlight them
- **AI Response Simulation** - Show how quoted text from AI responses gets highlighted  
- **Custom Highlighting** - Choose colors and terms for highlighting

#### Running the Demo
```bash
streamlit run examples/demo_highlighting.py
```

This demo is useful for:
- Testing the highlighting functionality
- Demonstrating features to users or stakeholders
- Development and debugging of new highlighting features
- Understanding how the highlighting system integrates with Streamlit

## Purpose

These files are kept separate from the main codebase to:
- Keep the main application clean and focused
- Provide easy access to demonstration tools
- Allow for experimentation without affecting production code
- Serve as documentation through working examples
